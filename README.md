# capitalbridge
Built with HTML, CSS, and Vue.JS. A quiz game that assists in learning country capitals, flags, and shortcodes at a go.

This repository contains renders of all the countries flags in PNG format, gotten from https://hampusborgos.github.io/country-flags/. Country Capitals, shortcode, flags were also taken from Wikipedia and google search results.

The flags are not under copyright protection since flags are in public domain (there may be other restrictions on how the flag can be used though).

I made every effort to maintain the most accurate data for each country, but this data may contain some mistakes and misinterpretations.

Feel free to fork, reuse and make recommendations to this project.
